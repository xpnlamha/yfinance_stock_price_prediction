**Project Duration:** May 2024

This study aims to forecast the closing stock prices of technology companies by leveraging a diverse range of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. The performance of these models is then rigorously evaluated using industry-standard metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Models Utilized:

* **Statistical Models:** Linear Regression, ARIMA, GARCH
* **Deep Learning Models:** LSTM, GRU, RNN
